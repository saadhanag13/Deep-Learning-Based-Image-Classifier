## Fashion MNIST Image Classifier

A deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates fundamental knowledge in image processing, neural network design, and model evaluation.

## 📂 Project Overview
Objective: Classify grayscale images (28x28) into 10 categories of fashion items.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

Dataset: Fashion MNIST — 70,000 images (60K training, 10K testing)

## 🛠️ Features & Workflow
✅ Data normalization

✅ One-hot encoding for multi-class classification

✅ CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout layers

✅ Model evaluation using accuracy, loss, and visualizations

✅ Clear visualization of test images

✅ Saved trained model as .h5 file
